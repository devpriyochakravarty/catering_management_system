 7. Database Schema

The project uses IndexedDB with the following object stores:

• products
• orders
• users

Each store has a unique identifier and relevant fields for storing data.

 8. Security Considerations

• This demo uses client-side storage. In a production environment, implement server-side authentication and data storage.
• Implement proper input validation and sanitization.
• Use HTTPS in a production environment to encrypt data in transit.

 9. Performance Optimization

• CSS animations are used judiciously to enhance user experience without impacting performance.
• IndexedDB is used for efficient client-side data storage and retrieval.
